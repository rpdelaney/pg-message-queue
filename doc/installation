INSTALLATION
------------

To install the extension so that PostgreSQL can find it:

make install

If you are using Linux with distro-supplied packages you may need to install 
the development packages.  Installations from source should be sufficient.

Then in psql, pgAdmin, or the like, run the following SQL query:

CREATE EXTENSION pg_message_queue;

If you would like to install an earlier version of pg_message_queue:

CREATE EXTENSION pg_message_queue VERSION '0.1';

UPGRADING FROM 0.1
--------------------

To upgrade from pg_message_queue 0.1:

CREATE EXTENSION pg_message_queue FROM VERSION '0.1';
